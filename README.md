# Predicting-Probability-of-Loan-Default
The Lending Club Loan Data contains 890 thousand entries of loan data for all loans issued through year 2007-2015. It includes current loan status, for example, “Current,” “Late,” and “Fully Paid,” as well as latest payment information. Features such as credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others are recorded in this data. Thus the goal is to use this historical data to set up a model in order to predict the probability of loan default for each specific case with similar features. Performance of the predication will be evaluated using test data. 

# Conclusion
Method using random forest shows the best result with a Log-less error of 0.36. However, as we can see for the random forest method, the accuracy is highly correlated with number of trees. The performance increases by 10 percent while ntree changes from 100 to 200. Runtime of random forest also depends on number of tree while that of bagging is not significantly changed by iterations. Moreover, prediction using generalized linear model provides acceptable Log-loss error (0.42) with pretty short runtime. In conclusion, if longer runtime and hardware with better performance can be obtained, prediction using random forest with ntree=1000 is recommended for this project.
