# Predicting-Probability-of-Loan-Default
The Lending Club Loan Data contains 890 thousand entries of loan data for all loans issued through year 2007-2015. It includes current loan status, for example, “Current,” “Late,” and “Fully Paid,” as well as latest payment information. Features such as credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others are recorded in this data. Thus the goal is to use this historical data to set up a model in order to predict the probability of loan default for each specific case with similar features. Performance of the predication will be evaluated using test data.
